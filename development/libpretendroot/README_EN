The libpretendroot shared library can be used through the LD_PRELOAD
mechanism. If this variable points to libpretendroot.so (with full path),
the dynamic linker will load this library.

In case the PRETENDROOT environment variable is unset, libpretendroot does
nothing, it simply calls the original versions of the standard library
calls.

To use this library for its purpose, you have to set this variable to point
to a filesystem directory which is readable and writeable by the real user.
This directory will be used to store the fake owner and group for all the
files whose fake owner and group is different from root.root.

The pretendroot script can be used to set up LD_PRELOAD.
