    The flex program generates scanners.  Scanners are programs which can
    recognize lexical patterns in text.  Flex takes pairs of regular
    expressions and C code as input and generates a C source file as
    output.  The output file is compiled and linked with a library to
    produce an executable.  The executable searches through its input for
    occurrences of the regular expressions.  When a match is found, it
    executes the corresponding C code.  Flex was designed to work with
    both Yacc and Bison, and is used by many programs as part of their
    build process.

    You should install flex if you are going to use your system for
    application development.
