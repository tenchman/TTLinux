    The GNU Compiler Collection contains frontends for C, C++, Objective-C,
    Fortran, Java, and Ada as well as libraries for these languages. It is
    a full-featured ANSI C compiler with support for K&R C as well. GCC
    provides many levels of source code error checking traditionally provided
    by other tools (such as lint), produces debugging information, and can
    perform many different optimizations to the resulting object code.
