    GNU Libtool is a set of shell scripts which automatically configure UNIX and
    UNIX-like systems to generically build shared libraries. Libtool provides a
    consistent, portable interface which simplifies the process of using shared
    libraries.

    If you are developing programs which will use shared libraries, but do not use
    the rest of the GNU Autotools (such as GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake), you
    should install the libtool package.

    The libtool package also includes all files needed to integrate the GNU
    Portable Library Tool (libtool) and the GNU Libtool Dynamic Module Loader
    (ltdl) into a package built using the GNU Autotools (including GNU Autoconf
    and GNU Automake).
