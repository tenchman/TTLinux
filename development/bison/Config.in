    Bison is a general purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
    description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C program to
    parse that grammar. Bison can be used to develop a wide range of
    language parsers, from ones used in simple desk calculators to complex
    programming languages. Bison is upwardly compatible with Yacc, so any
    correctly written Yacc grammar should work with Bison without any
    changes. If you know Yacc, you shouldn't have any trouble using
    Bison. You do need to be very proficient in C programming to be able
    to use Bison. Bison is only needed on systems that are used for
    development.

    If your system will be used for C development, you should install
    Bison.
