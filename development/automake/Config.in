    Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in'
    files compliant with the GNU Coding Standards.

    You should install Automake if you are developing software and would
    like to use its ability to automatically generate GNU standard
    Makefiles. If you install Automake, you will also need to install
    GNU's Autoconf package.
