    PCRE has its own native API, but a set of "wrapper" functions that are based on
    the POSIX API are also supplied in the library libpcreposix. Note that this
    just provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE: the regular expressions
    themselves still follow Perl syntax and semantics. The header file
    for the POSIX-style functions is called pcreposix.h.
