    SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large
    subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a
    single disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of use.
    Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and
    flexiblity of an SQL database without the administrative hassles of
    supporting a separate database server.  Version 2 and version 3 binaries
    are named to permit each to be installed on a single host
