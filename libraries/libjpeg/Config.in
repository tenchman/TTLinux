    The libjpeg package contains a library of functions for manipulating
    JPEG images, as well as simple client programs for accessing the
    libjpeg functions.  Libjpeg client programs include cjpeg, djpeg,
    jpegtran, rdjpgcom and wrjpgcom.  Cjpeg compresses an image file into
    JPEG format.  Djpeg decompresses a JPEG file into a regular image
    file.  Jpegtran can perform various useful transformations on JPEG
    files.  Rdjpgcom displays any text comments included in a JPEG file.
    Wrjpgcom inserts text comments into a JPEG file.
