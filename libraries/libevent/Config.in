  The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when
  a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been
  reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals or
  regular timeouts.

  libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven network
  servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and then add or
  remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop.
