    The libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and
    manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.  PNG
    is a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format.  PNG was
    created to replace the GIF format, since GIF uses a patented data
    compression algorithm.
