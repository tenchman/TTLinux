    From the homepage of libowfat:
    
    One of the best ways to learn good programming practices is to read
    others people's code. I have read the source code from a lot of people.
    One of the most inspiring moments of my career as C programmer was to
    look at Dan Bernstein's code. While most programmers stumble about bad
    APIs throughout their life, Dan started not only question them, but he
    defined new and better APIs and implemented them.
