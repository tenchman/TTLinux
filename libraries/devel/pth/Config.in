    Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms which
    provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple threads of
    execution (aka ``multithreading'') inside event-driven applications. All
    threads run in the same address space of the server application, but each
    thread has it's own individual program-counter, run-time stack, signal
    mask and errno variable.
