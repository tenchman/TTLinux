    Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
    monitoring.  Libpcap can provide network statistics collection,
    security monitoring and network debugging.  Since almost every system
    vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap
    authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
    alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
    in each application.

    Install libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring
    on your network.
