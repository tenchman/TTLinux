    The router advertisement daemon (radvd) is run by Linux or BSD systems
    acting as IPv6 routers. It sends Router Advertisement messages, specified
    by RFC 2461, to a local Ethernet LAN periodically and when requested by a
    node sending a Router Solicitation message. These messages are required
    for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration.
