    httptunnel creates a bidirectional virtual data connection tunnelled in
    HTTP requests. The HTTP requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy if so desired.

    This can be useful for users behind restrictive firewalls. If WWW access is
    allowed through a HTTP proxy, it's possible to use httptunnel and, say, telnet
    or PPP to connect to a computer outside the firewall.
