  help
	Bogofilter is a Bayesian spam filter. In its normal mode of operation, it
	takes an email message or other text on standard input, does a statistical
	check against lists of "good" and "bad" words, and returns a status code
	indicating whether or not the message is spam. Bogofilter is designed with
	fast algorithms (including Berkeley DB system), coded directly in C, and
	tuned for speed, so it can be used for production by sites that process a
	lot of mail.
