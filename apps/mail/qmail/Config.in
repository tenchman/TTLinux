	Qmail is a small, fast, secure replacement for the sendmail package,
	which is the program that actually receives, routes, and delivers
	electronic mail.  *** Note: Be sure and read the documentation as there
	are some small but very significant differences between sendmail and
	qmail and the programs that interact with them.
