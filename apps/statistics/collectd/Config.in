    Collectd is a small and modular daemon which collects system information
    periodically and provides means to store the values. Included in the
    distribution are numerous plug-ins for collecting CPU, disk, and memory
    usage, network interface and DNS traffic, network latency, database
    statistics, and much more. Custom statistics can easily be added in a
    number of ways, including execution of arbitrary programs and plug-ins
    written in Perl. Advanced features include a powerful network code to
    collect statistics for entire setups and SNMP integration to query
    network equipment.
