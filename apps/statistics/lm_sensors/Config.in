    lm_sensors  provides  essential  tools  and  drivers  for  monitoring  the
    temperatures, voltages, and fans of Linux systems with hardware monitoring
    devices. It contains Linux 2.4 drivers for  sensor chips and I2C and SMBus
    masters, text-based  tools for sensor reporting, and a library for sensors
    access  called "libsensors".  It also  contains tools for  sensor hardware
    identification and I2C bus probing.

      You doesn't need this if you use collectd with lm_sensors support.

      If you are unsure, answer N.
