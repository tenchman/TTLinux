    Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of
    this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning).
    The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a
    command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet. The
    programs are based on a shared library distributed with the Clam AntiVirus
    package, which you can use with your own software. Most importantly, the
    virus database is kept up to date .
