  bool "DHCP Forwarder - forward DHCP messages between subnets"

  help
    This program forwards DHCP messages between subnets with different sublayer
    broadcast domains. It is similarly to the DHCP relay agent dhcrelay of
    ISC's DHCP, but has the following features which are important for someone:
      
      * Runs as non-root in a chroot-jail
      * Uses "normal" AF_INET sockets; this allows to uses packetfilters to
	filter incoming messages.
      * The DHCP agent IDs can be defined freely
      * Has a small memory footprint when using dietlibc

    It tries to be RFC 2131/2132 and 3046 compliant. Probably it works with
    BOOTP (RFC 951) also, but since the handling of the giaddr field is
    described misleading (see RFC 1542), there may occur problems.
