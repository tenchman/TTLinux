    Keepalived for LVS aims to add a strong and robust keepalive facility
    to the Linux Virtual Server project. This project is written in C with
    multilayer TCP/IP stack checks. It implements a framework based on three
    family checks: Layer3, Layer4, and Layer5. This framework gives the daemon
    the ability of checking a LVS server pool states. When one of the servers
    in the LVS server pool is down, keepalived informs the Linux kernel via a
    setsockopt call to remove this server entry from the LVS topology. In
    addition, it implements a VRRPv2 stack to handle director failover.
