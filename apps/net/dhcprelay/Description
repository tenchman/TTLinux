A light-weight DHCP Relay Agent.

Why not the ISC DHCP Relay Agent?

  - If your RA has multiple interfaces, you get multiple requests for
    each request:

    DHCPREQUEST for 10.199.14.216 from 00:10:dc:d1:e6:39 (foo) via 10.199.14.1
    DHCPACK on 10.199.14.216 to 00:10:dc:d1:e6:39 (foo) via 10.199.14.1
    DHCPREQUEST for 10.199.14.216 from 00:10:dc:d1:e6:39 (foo) via 10.10.3.5: wrong network.
    DHCPNAK on 10.199.14.216 to 00:10:dc:d1:e6:39 via 10.10.3.5

    This RA sends only one request, coming with the IP address of the
    LAN the request came from.

  - If your RA has multiple interfaces, the outgoing interfaces to
    the WAN needs to be active in the DHCP relay otherwise answers
    are not picked up.

    This RA uses a unicast socket for returning answers.

  - If your RA has non-ethernet interfaces (GIF-tunnels for example,
    which VPN back to the central network), the answers are not picked
    up by the RA.
