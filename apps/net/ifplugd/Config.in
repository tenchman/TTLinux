    ifplugd is a Linux daemon which will automatically configure your ethernet
    device when a cable is  plugged in and automatically unconfigure it if the
    cable is  pulled. This is useful on laptops  with onboard network adapters,
    since  it  will  only  configure  the interface  when a  cable  is  really
    connected.
