    strongSwan is an OpenSource IPsec implementation for the Linux operating
    system. It is based on the discontinued FreeS/WAN project and the X.509
    patch which we developped over the last three years. In order to have a
    stable IPsec platform to base our future extensions of the X.509 capability
    on, we decided to lauch the strongSwan project.

    The focus is on
      
      * simplicity of configuration
      * strong encryption and authentication methods
      * powerful IPsec policies supporting large and complex VPN networks

    The maintainer of the strongSwan project is Andreas Steffen, who is a
    professor for security in communications at the University of Applied
    Sciences Rapperswil in Switzerland and president of the consulting firm
    strongSec GmbH.
