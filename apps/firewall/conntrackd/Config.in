	Conntrackd is the userspace daemon for the Netfilter's Connection 
	Tracking System. This daemon maintains a copy of the Connection
	Tracking System in userspace. It is entirely written in C and is
	highly configurable and easily extensible. Currently it covers the
	specific aspects of Stateful Linux firewalls to enable high
	availability solutions and can be used as statistics collector of the
	firewall use.
